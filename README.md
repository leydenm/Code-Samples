Examples of programs I created for myself

Compress jpeg
a simple Windows front-end for MozJpeg
The setup is complex enough to outweigh the convenience of having file dialog.  I set it up for somebody who would be deterred by a command line interface.
Setup:
Download and build MozJpeg. https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg

Palindrome Search
A PERL progam for searching for all possible palindromes in a text file.
run: 
  perl palindromes.pl [path to text file]
